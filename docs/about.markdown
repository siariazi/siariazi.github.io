How much quantitative information is needed to predict a biological system? My research focuses on developing computational and mathematical tools to understand and predict biological systems. Currently I’m working on developing a new way to predict the spread of a viral disease over the course of an epidemic. I’m a computational biologist with a background in mathematical modeling of bacterial physiology/biochemistry. During my PhD I worked with [Chris Marx](https://marxlab.org/) and [Chris Remien](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/cremien/index.html) at University of Idaho. I developed a mathematical model to understand the physiological response of *Methylobacterium extorquens* to formaldehyde toxicity. This bacteria is a facultative Methylobacterium that lives naturally on plant leaves, and it is regularly exposed to formaldehyde. Further I used statistical methods to analyze global gene expression response of *M. extorquens* to formaldehyde toxicity and I investigated the role of EfgA, a newly found protein in tolerance to formaldehyde toxicity. In my current research I’m working on developing a new method to estimate epidemiological parameters from a given viral phylogenetic tree during the course of an epidemic. The research involves both stochastic and deterministic mathematical modeling, phylogenetic analysis and investigating parameter estimation methods.
